Epigenetic mechanisms involve chemical and physical changes to the structure of DNA without any changes in the underlying genetic sequence. Epigenetics allows for fine-tuned control of gene expression and is the basic mechanism whereby a single human genome can give rise to hundreds of different cell types in the adult organism. We are interested in understanding how epigenetic aberrations are related to cancer and other diseases.

We work in four main areas:

- Genome Topology
- Single-cell epigenetics
- Clinical cancer biomarkers
- Genome editing
