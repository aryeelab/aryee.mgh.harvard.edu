*hichipper* is an open-source command-line toolkit that performs restriction fragment bias-aware preprocessing of HiChIP data. This package uses preprocessed data from HiC-Pro and produces output that can be used to 1) determine library quality, 2) identify and characterize DNA loops and 3) interactively visualize loops. Loops are assigned strength and confidence metrics that can be used to evaluate samples individually or for differential analysis in downstream tools.

See the [Documentation](https://hichipper.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
