We develop computational and statistical methods for extracting signal from noisy genomic datasets, with a focus on cancer epigenomics. Our group membersâ€™ interests range from understanding the basic epigenetic mechanisms underlying human disease, to developing blood-based early cancer detection diagnostics and understanding how genome and epigenome editing can be used to reverse disease-causing mutations.
